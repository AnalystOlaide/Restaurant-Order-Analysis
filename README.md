## üìå Project Title  
**Restaurant Orders Analysis**

## üìÑ Project Overview  
This project explores three months of restaurant order data to uncover insights about customer preferences, item performance, and revenue trends. The restaurant offers international cuisine and operates with a digital ordering system.

The analysis is designed to help the business:

- Identify **revenue drivers**

## ‚ùì Problem Statement  
Restaurant managers often struggle with questions like:

Using SQL, this project answers these questions through structured data analysis.
